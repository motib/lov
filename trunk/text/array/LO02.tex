\subsection{Array initializers}\label{array.02}

\textbf{Concept} An array object can be created implicitly by giving a list of values 
within braces.

\prg{Array02}\prgl{array}{Array02}

The program initializes an array with values of the fibonacci sequence.
\begin{itemize}
\item Initially, the variable \texttt{fib} of type integer array (denoted \texttt{int[]}) is allocated. 
\item \emph{As part of the same statement}, the array object is created and 
its seven fields contain the values from the initializer.
\item Only then is the reference to the object returned and stored in the variable \texttt{fib}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Exercise} Can an element of an array initializer be the value of
an expression containing variables previously declared? Modify this program
accordingly and try to compile and run it. Explain what happens.
